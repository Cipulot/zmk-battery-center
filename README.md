### My keyboard does not show up

- Make sure your keyboard is connected to your computer via Bluetooth.
- Make sure your keyboard has the following ZMK configs enabled:
  ```kconfig
  CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_REPORTING=y
  # for split keyboards:
  CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_BATTERY_LEVEL_FETCHING=y
  CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_BATTERY_LEVEL_PROXY=y
  ```
  Refer to [ZMK Docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/config/battery) for more details.
- If you are on macOS, make sure the Bluetooth permission is granted.
