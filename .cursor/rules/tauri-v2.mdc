# Instructions for Coding AI: Tauri v2 Project Development

## Important: Always Reference Current Documentation

When assisting with Tauri v2 project, please always reference the latest official documentation. Tauri is a new framework that recently upgraded to v2, so your training data and web information may be outdated.

## Official Documentation References

Always check these authoritative sources when providing code suggestions or solutions:
- Tauri v2 Configuration Reference: https://v2.tauri.app/reference/config/
- Tauri Rust API Documentation: https://docs.rs/tauri/2.5.0/tauri/

## When Providing Assistance

1. Begin by checking if your knowledge matches the current Tauri v2 API
2. If unclear about a specific API or configuration option, explicitly state this and refer to the documentation links
3. Never assume deprecated v1 patterns will work in v2
4. When suggesting code, explain the reasoning behind it and highlight any v2-specific considerations
5. If multiple approaches are possible, explain trade-offs with reference to the documentation

## Key Areas to Reference Documentation

- App configuration structure and options
- Window management and customization
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication) patterns
- Plugin system and available official plugins
- Security features and best practices
- Build and bundling options


By consistently referencing the official documentation, you'll help ensure that the code we develop follows current best practices for Tauri v2.
